## Instructions to run code:

1. In the two folders - client and server - complile the respective cpp files. Use `g++ <file>.cpp`
2. Start the execution for the server. Do `./a.out` in folder `server`.
3. Start the execution for the client. Do `./a.out` in folder `client`.
4. Use `get <filename>` as the `client/a.out` file gets executed, to download files from server folder to the client folder.
5. Use `exit` to disconnect client from server.
